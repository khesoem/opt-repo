The root of the '{repo-name}' project is at '/workspace/project'. The project uses uses the Maven wrapper ./mvnw. The unit tests for the '{buggy-module}' module(s) of the project can be executed as follows:
  ./mvnw -pl {buggy-module} -am test -DfailIfNoTests=false -DskipITs

Note that running the test with the command above should usually take less than 300 seconds, including compiling, building, and executing the tests.

In this project, there is a performance issue in terms of execution time. The issue appears in the '{buggy-module}' module(s) of the project and can be described as follows:
###ISSUE DESCRIPTION BEGINS###
ISSUE TITLE: {issue-title}
ISSUE DESCRIPTION:
{issue-description}
###ISSUE DESCRIPTION ENDS###

This issue can be fixed by changing the following file(s) of the project:
{buggy-files}

Your task is to generate a patch that fixes the issue described above by changing the mentioned files. The result should be saved in a '/workspace/project/fix.patch' file that can be easily applied on the original version later.

Follow this loop:
0) Go into the project folder: cd '/workspace/project'.
1) Plan: make a plan of the steps you will take.
2) Fault localization: identify which parts of the code should be changed.
3) Patch generation: patch the project to fix the issue by modifying the detected faulty lines.
4) Patch validation: run the tests with the './mvnw -pl {buggy-module} -am test -DfailIfNoTests=false -DskipITs' command and ensure the project successfully builds and all tests pass. If this validation step fails, revert to the original version and start again from the fault localization step.
5) Summarize: save your the patch in a file at '/workspace/project/fix.patch'. Note that the project at '/workspace/project' is a git repo. There is also a snapshot of the original version at `/workspace/project_original'. Also, git is installed on the machine and you can use it if needed.

Note that you should not look for the code in a different directory. You are starting at '/workspace/project/', which is exactly the root of the project and there is no need to look for files in the parent directory.
