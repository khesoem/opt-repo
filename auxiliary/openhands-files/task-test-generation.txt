You have to generate tests that demonstrate the execution time improvement made by a patch on the '{repo-name}' project.

Two versions of this project are given: the root of the original version is located at '/workspace/original_repo' and the reoot of the patched version is located at '/workspace/patched_repo'. The diff of these two versions, computed with git diff, is also given at '/workspace/diff.patch'. The diff modifies the '{buggy-module}' module(s).
The patched version of the project is faster than the original version and fixes the following issue:
###ISSUE DESCRIPTION BEGINS###
ISSUE TITLE: {issue-title}
ISSUE DESCRIPTION:
{issue-description}
###ISSUE DESCRIPTION ENDS###

The '{repo-name}' project uses Maven wrapper ./mvnw.
You can run JUnit tests for this modified modules with:
  ./mvnw -pl {buggy-module} -am test -Dtest=packagename.GeneratedTests -Dsurefire.runOrder=alphabetical -DfailIfNoTests=false -DskipITs
where packagename.GeneratedTests is the fully qualified name of the test class you want to execute.

Note that when running JUnit tests the time spent by a test class, for example with the name packagename.TestClass1, is given in the maven log in a line similar to what follows:
[INFO] Tests run: 9, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.048 s -- in packagename.TestClass1

Your task is to generate tests whose execution time on the faster version (/workspace/patched_repo) is lower than their execution time on the slower version (/workspace/original_repo).
At the end, you should produce a patch file '/workspace/tests_addition_diff.patch' and a list file '/workspace/improvement_tests.txt'. I should be able to apply the patch on the original and patched versions with git apply, and then run the test class(es) in the list file. The list file should contain the fully qualified name of a test class at each line.

Note that running the test with the './mvnw -pl {buggy-module} -am test -Dsurefire.runOrder=alphabetical -DfailIfNoTests=false -DskipITs -DtrimStackTrace=false -q' command above should usually take less than 300 seconds, including compiling, building, and executing the tests.

Follow this loop:
1) Plan: make a plan of the steps you will take.
2) Design and implement execution time tests that stress the changed code in the {buggy-module} module(s). Prefer JUnit over JMH. If you decide to use JMH, also update the relevant pom.xml files so the project still builds and the benchmarks can be run via Maven. The execution time of the generated tests on the patched version should be lower than their execution time on the faster version.
3) Verify: after you generate new tests, run the generated tests. If the build or tests fail, fix the issues and re-run until they pass.
4) Produce: the '/workspace/tests_addition_diff.patch' and '/workspace/improvement_tests.txt' files.

Also, explain the generated tests in a file at '/workspace/EXPLANATION.md', if you think explanation is needed.
