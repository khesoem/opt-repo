RemovedBeansPerformanceTest: A JUnit test that constructs a large Jandex index with 120 simple @Singleton classes which are unused and therefore treated as removable beans. The test invokes BeanProcessor.process(), which exercises generation of components including removed-beans handling in ComponentsProviderGenerator. The patched change reduces the internal group size used by the ComponentAdder for removed beans, which improves performance when processing many removed beans. The test prints the elapsed time (ms) which is captured by Maven Surefire as the test duration. The test class is named io.quarkus.arc.processor.perf.RemovedBeansPerformanceTest and is included in the improvement_tests.txt file.
