This reduces the performance and creates more garbage  making life harder for the garbage collector later.  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2df372b-dd79-48ba-8cfd-44b0c72cb440)  Modification:  Removed `Result` class instance allocations in MqttDecoder.  Result:  Reduced class instance allocations lead to improved performance and reduced garbage.

This improves key lookup efficiency and reduces storage size  while also making the state resilient to renaming of enum constants  which would otherwise break lookup logic based on string names.
igniterealtime,Openfire,14832dacf84faf3cef2f6e29ee0efda52dd9ea20,https://github.com/igniterealtime/Openfire/commit/14832dacf84faf3cef2f6e29ee0efda52dd9ea20,OF-3048: Improve ClientSession comparison performance (clustering)  Comparing ClientSessions typically involves evaluating the 'is anonymous' property of a session.  In a cluster  the property value of remote sessions is retrieved under guard of a distributed lock. As comparison of larger sets frequently evaluates the property value  that lock is obtained very frequently. This dramatically reduces performance.  As the property will never change after authentication  it's safe to cache the value. This improves performance considerably.  Note that RemoteClientSession instances are typically short-lived (as they're typically discarded after use)  which reduces the effectiveness of this change. Still  even without re-use  the performance improvement is considerable: in a cluster with 10 000 sessions  the responsiveness of the session summary page is improved from many minutes to 20 to 30 seconds in my test environment.

This resulted in having buffer allocations spread out and so we could observe multiple TLB misses when the kernel tried to use the buffer ring. To reduce this we should better fill the whole ring at once and so allow the user to do a large allocation for the whole ring and then slice out the buffers as need while also still allow to do one allocation per buffer.  Modifications:  - Introduce IoUringBufferRingAllocator.allocateBulk(...) and use it from the IoUringBufferRing - Add abstract base class for IoUringBufferRingAllocator and extend it from our existing allocators. These now support large allocations or normal allocations  Result:  Better performance and much more flexibility

This should avoid having rocksDB changing the files on disk while performing get operations.  The `forEach` method from `RawTransactionalColumnFamily` has been defined as static as well  in order to be used from `SnapshotOnlyDb` as well  as it does not have an open transaction.  A new `forEachPreallocated` method preallocates `byte [] key  byte[] value` in order to avoid allocating altogether when iterating. To avoid introducing new bugs  a new method has been created  so that the caller knows that the `byte[]` received cannot be used outside the invoked callback.  ## Integration tests: - this fix is tested by PR #34495 (stacked on this branch) ## Related issues  closes #34430

This increases the stack depth in event loop threads  which makes it harder to debug (people have more ceremony mixed in with their code)  and hurts performance (JIT inliner budget gets used up faster).  Furthermore  there are other places in this machinery which can be made faster.  Modification:  **1.** In the `AbstractChannelHandlerContext` all inbound methods  e.g. `fireChannelRead`  have been manually inlined. This means that when a handler calls `ctx.fireChannelRead`  this method call in turn now directly call the `channelRead` method of the _next_ handler in the pipeline. Previously  we had two extra method calls here.  As a consequence of this inlining  we now have to re-compute the target context when we trampoline tasks onto the event-loop. This is presumably rare  and worth the cost. This also means that some code now moves from the executor of the target context  to the executor of the calling context. This can create different behaviors from Netty 4.1  if the pipeline has multiple handlers  is modified by the handlers during the call  and the handlers use child-executors.  **2.** A few outbound methods - `read`  `write`  `writeAndFlush` - are likewise inlined. Their inherent complexity and number of overloads means we can't realistically get them down to a single method call  but we can get them down to two. This is still a nice improvement. The `flush` method is usually not implemented by handlers  so there's no point in inlining that further.  **3.** In every such call  after finding the next context  we have to decide if we can call the handler directly  or need to trampoline onto a different event loop (due to the executor off-loading feature). This means we have to inspect the context and either pick its child executor  or load the channel event loop of the target context  and this latter part (which is the most common case) is a sequence of dependent loads. Dependent loads cause cache misses and CPU pipeline stalls  so to deal with this the `AbstractChannelHandlerContext` now has a `contextExecutor` field  which caches the result of computing the concrete executor. This means our executor is only one dependent (on the channel handler context) load away. The speedup from this is quite noticeable because it's such a common operation.    Results: The `DefaultChannelPipelineBenchmark` on my M1 Pro  running JDK 17  tells an encouraging story:  ``` Before: Benchmark                                         (extraHandlers)  (pipelineArrayLength)   Mode  Cnt        Score        Error  Units DefaultChannelPipelineBenchmark.propagateEvent                 16                   1024  thrpt   10  6515502.983 ± 253375.107  ops/s DefaultChannelPipelineBenchmark.propagateVariety               16                   1024  thrpt   10  7628162.835 ±  40168.895  ops/s  After: Benchmark                                         (extraHandlers)  (pipelineArrayLength)   Mode  Cnt        Score        Error  Units DefaultChannelPipelineBenchmark.propagateEvent                 16                   1024  thrpt   50  6899710.275 ± 115305.284  ops/s DefaultChannelPipelineBenchmark.propagateVariety               16                   1024  thrpt   50  7985208.748 ±  31532.793  ops/s ```

In the case of spillable hash tables  spilling will involve sorting the table contents based on the raw hash value- which can be extremely expensive if the value is being recomputed on each comparison compared to simply accessed from the table.  Similarly  re-hashing large FlatGroupByHash instances can be significantly more expensive without the hash value cached when there are a large number of columns or when the hash calculation itself is relatively expensive.

I noticed the AdaptiveByteBuf was sending the call down a path with a more indirections than strictly necessary.  Modification: Implement `setCharSequence` in the `AdaptiveByteBuf` so we skip a level of indirections. This is especially profitable for direct/off-heap buffers  where we see up to a 50% performance improvement in the benchmark. The benefit is greater the longer the string is.  Interestingly  the benchmark also show that it isn't profitable to do this for the `getCharSequence` sibling method.  Result: Direct buffers from the adaptive allocator now have much faster `setCharSequence`  which will help with HTTP header encoding.

This is due to resizing being done in increments of `len` passed to `ensureAvailable(int len)` when doubling the current buffer length with a bit shift would overflow and become a negative value.  This means that the buffer is potentially continuously extended by small increments  instead of a single large increment (which is the intention with a doubling strategy).  This PR resolves the issue by catching the overflow case and setting the buffer's length to a `MAX_ARRAY_SIZE` value  which is approximately the largest supported array size possible.  This is the simplest solution to the problem encountered  and fits with the current doubling strategy within the limits of the JVM. We could overhaul our buffering mechanism entirely and use a segmented approach  trading some additional overheads for a more robust solution that supports larger inputs - this is definitely a more complex solution  and is likely overkill for Hazelcast's use-case. I discussed these options with @gbarnett-hz and he agreed that the simple approach is sufficient for now.  This PR also includes a test case that increases the existing `ByteArrayObjectDataOutput` test coverage.

The goal is to make the query plan look the same as if the udf was not being called on the struct. In order to accomplish this  the user defined function needs to take the struct argument passed into it  and unwrap it when converting an expression to a subfield.  Since there is no guarantee that the struct argument is always the first argument in the udf  the udf needs to specify which argument index to push down in its metadata.

We were able to complete a lot of process instances  and also to export them to ES. But they haven't been moved to the dated indices quickly enough  causing to fill up ES at some point.  We can see in the following metric that we complete per partition ~50 process instances (on the medic benchmarks)  but only ~5% are actually moved to the dated indices  where they can be deleted by ILM later.  ![archiver-lagging-behind](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/354d052e-abc1-42b1-8526-4d43b74c0e58)  We haven't had not much observability around this topic and missed some visualization (previously we added some panels via #30679). On top of this  the PR adds some more panels to better visualize the archiving  and how many instances are actually found to be archived.  This allowed better to pinpoint where the bottleneck was  querying the completed process instances. Especially that it is not easy to fine-tune related `rolloverBatchSize` as it would simply stop finding new results  ![2025-04-07_14-46](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5106cf19-621f-4711-b7e4-946bd963ed48)  It turned out to be an issue with the used aggregation  also highlighted by @lenaschoenburg [previously](https://camunda.slack.com/archives/C08D74J6HUG/p1744033725997889?thread_ts=1744030148.764179&cid=C08D74J6HUG).

With normal usage  this requires us to perform some allocation - either the `Meter.Id` in order to pick it up  or some option like a `Tuple` or `Tuple3` or `Triple`. @entangled90 and I benchmarked these approaches  and the one without allocations (using a map with 3 keys) is  as expected  much faster. Some quick JMH results:  When using strings for keys:  ``` Benchmark                                                          Mode    Cnt        Score    Error   Units MetricCachingTest.measureTimeToIncrementTuples                     thrpt   50       17.868 ±  0.531   ops/s MetricCachingTest.measureTimeToIncrementTuples:gc.alloc.rate       thrpt   50      51.116 ±  3.121  MB/sec MetricCachingTest.measureTimeToIncrementTuples:gc.alloc.rate.norm  thrpt   50  3000382.667 ± 21.107    B/op  Benchmark                                                         Mode    Cnt    Score   Error   Units MetricCachingTest.measureTimeToIncrementMap3D                     thrpt   50  27.923 ± 1.302   ops/s MetricCachingTest.measureTimeToIncrementMap3D:gc.alloc.rate       thrpt   50    0.006 ± 0.001  MB/sec MetricCachingTest.measureTimeToIncrementMap3D:gc.alloc.rate.norm  thrpt   50   237.517 ± 5.155    B/op ```  When using enum for keys:  ``` Benchmark                                                          Mode    Cnt        Score    Error   Units MetricCachingTest.measureTimeToIncrementTuples                     thrpt   50       50.179 ±  0.710   ops/s MetricCachingTest.measureTimeToIncrementTuples:gc.alloc.rate       thrpt   50      143.543 ±  2.031  MB/sec MetricCachingTest.measureTimeToIncrementTuples:gc.alloc.rate.norm  thrpt   50  3000142.014 ± 21.107    B/op MetricCachingTest.measureTimeToIncrementTuples:gc.count            thrpt   50        3.000           counts MetricCachingTest.measureTimeToIncrementTuples:gc.time             thrpt   50        4.000               ms  Benchmark                                                         Mode    Cnt    Score   Error   Units MetricCachingTest.measureTimeToIncrementMap3D                     thrpt   50  125.315 ± 1.302   ops/s MetricCachingTest.measureTimeToIncrementMap3D:gc.alloc.rate       thrpt   50    0.007 ± 0.001  MB/sec MetricCachingTest.measureTimeToIncrementMap3D:gc.alloc.rate.norm  thrpt   50   56.932 ± 7.755    B/op ```  > [!Note] > To keep things fair  we refactored our tuples to be records in the hope that both immutable values and using records would nudge the JVM to avoid allocations.  > [!Note] > The actual benchmark will be added in a comment below.  Since metrics are in the hot path quite often  I think it's worth ensuring we're keeping things fast/light  and avoiding allocations is one of the best way to do this.  Also interesting is you will note that the benchmarks where we use enums for keys are much  much faster  which can be attributed (though we did not dig into it) to having the comparison/hash code being much faster.  ## MArray/Map3D/Table  The PR introduces a new generic multi-dimensional array structure which is variadic. It's not meant to be used directly all the time  but you can put it behind an interface to enforce some types and leverage the compiler.  You can see how `Map3D` and `Table` both use it under the hood for their enum counter parts. It's a little more verbose  I'll admit  which I'm not too happy about.  ## Related issues  related to #26078

We're seeing `TextFormatUtil#writeEscapedLabelValue` show up in our production traces due to the single `char` writes to `OutputStreamWriter`. We're using `OpenMetricsTextFormatWriter`. #1241 and #1248 should take care of most of these issues but there still remains some optimization potential left. `BufferedWriter#write(int)` has some minimal overhead in terms of locking. If we assume that rarely any characters need to be escaped and instead optimize to write as large of a part of the String as possible in one method call.

Since these checks were already performed during the initial command processing  redoing them is redundant.

If the server supports multiple protocols  the method `setEnabledProtocols0` calls `HashSet.contains` for every enabled protocol  making it notable during profiling:  ``` for (String protocol : protocols) { if (!OpenSsl.SUPPORTED_PROTOCOLS_SET.contains(protocol)) { ```  Modification:  Replaced `set.contains` with switch + shift operations. This approach is ~5 times faster (according to my microbenchmarks) than `map.contains` + small cleanups along the road.  Result:  Less CPU usage on initial connection when multiple protocols are supported.  ---------  Co-authored-by: Chris Vest <christianvest_hansen@apple.com>

Therefore  the intent filter needs to be executed before exporting.  ExporterContainer Each configured exporter is wrapped into an exporter container instance. Before exporting  the `acceptRecord` method is called to filter based on configured RecordFilter. It is updated to filter for intent as well.  ExporterDirector This class holds all configured exporters and manages the lifecycle of exporting. It has a `createEventFilter` method where it collects all `RecordFilter`s from all configured exporters. Then  creates a global filter. This is used to prevent unnecessary `exportRecord` call if none of the exporter filters match that record.

Motivation:  When we use a buffer ring and receive ENOBUFS we should just let the user know and retry with a buffer ring again. This works as expected as we always refill the buffer ring once we used a buffer out of it. At the moment we will fallback to do a read loop without a buffer ring which slows down things without any benefits.  Modifications:  Just retry directly with a buffer ring.

This made it hard to fine-tune. * The general change was motivated by 819c0b70ac6356f1a49e0f7f3fb6ee33a8feee4c from @lenaschoenburg

However  these are now deprecated. To ensure consistent performance  I override SingleThreadEventLoop.newTaskQueue to return an MpscQueue  This also helps avoid potential deadlocks when the EventLoop is used as a virtual thread scheduler.  For example  thread A calls submit() and acquires the putLock of a blocking queue. Meanwhile  the EventLoop-vt also calls submit()  but gets blocked trying to acquire the same lock and parks. The EventLoop itself later calls submit() and also parks. When thread A releases the putLock  it attempts to wake up the EventLoop-vt  but the EventLoop is already parked leading to a deadlock.  Modification:  Replace LinkedBlockingQueue with MPSCQueue in SingleThreadIoEventLoop  Result:  ---------  Co-authored-by: Norman Maurer <norman_maurer@apple.com>

This provides another [alternative to using `Unsafe`](https://github.com/google/guava/issues/6806).  And port the benchmark to JMH  which for now means making it Google-internal. (Not that we have our _Caliper_ benchmarks actually _running_ externally  either  IIRC.)  The benchmarks suggest that the old  `Unsafe`-based implementation is faster up to 64 elements or so but that it's a matter of only about a nanosecond. The new implementation pulls ahead for larger arrays  including an advantage of about 5-10 ns for 1024 elements.  For now  I've included this implementation only in the JRE flavor of Guava. We could include it in the Android flavor  too  to see if it helps [under API Level 33+](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Arrays#compareUnsigned(byte[] %20byte[])). But we really would want to do yet more benchmarking for that.  RELNOTES=n/a PiperOrigin-RevId: 714130759

If the `userTaskKey` is missing or invalid  an `IllegalStateException` is thrown  indicating a data inconsistency  as this shouldn't happen during a normal engine operation.

We don't need schema for these operations and it should be sufficient to refresh the schema only before taking the actual snapshot. At this point fo time tables are already lock  so we take schema refresh from consitent DB view.

But the current implementation uses views which can be expensive  because it requires a query. This PR adds support to read BigLake tables directly using the storage API.  There are no behavior changes for external tables and BQ native tables - they use the view and storage APIs respectively.  Added a new test for BigLake tables.

Compare cl/713006636.  (Also  better document the similar code in `AbstractFuture`.)  Note that I also evaluated performance with `VarHandle`  and I found it no better. (Maybe we did a similar experiment with `Unsafe` way back when and came to a similar conclusion?)  Note that that's all based on _JVM_ performance (and on benchmarks that are not necessarily great). It's possible that Android it worth a further look someday. But our only option there _today_ might be `Unsafe`  and new usages of `Unsafe` would be moving backward.

Instead  now `VariableDocumentState` (including both `variableDocumentKey` and `variableDocumentRecord`) is stored directly by `scopeKey`.  This reduces the number of lookups needed to retrieve and remove a `VariableDocumentRecord` with a key.

Failing to do so increase the memory usage and also hurts the performance in general and so will reduce throughtput  Modifications:  - Add a new class which is used to drain the CompletionQueue before finally run the completions - When we do a flush() and detect that the Channel became unwritable trigger a submit (io_uring_enter) and directly obtain the completions and run them. This will ensure we can release buffers directly when the socket is writable as the write will be executed inline by io_uring_enter.

To speed up the context cleanup in such a scenario  this changes the TasksService to track the failed job within its `recentlyFailed` cache.  Relates to https://github.com/crate/crate/pull/17963 in that the unlimited backoff policy helped uncover this.

The ByteBufs allocated by the adaptive allocator also support this  but has thus far required a round-trip through the allocator every time. In contrast  the pooled allocator is reserving the chunk run-size when allocating buffers  and very cheaply allow smaller buffers to bump up to the run-size limit. This is an important performance optimisation in practice. We can do something similar in the adaptive allocator  because we keep statistics about the buffer sizes that we allocate.  Modification: The adaptive allocator now reserves space equal to the 99-percentile buffer size (though with some reasonable heuristic limits for smaller buffers)  when allocating buffers  and allow its ByteBufs to cheaply bump their capacities up to this limit. We already compute this percentile during histogram rotation  so it is simply a matter of storing this value in the magazine  and then using it when reserving space out of chunks.  The collection of buffer size statistics is now also delayed and moved to when the `ByteBuf` instances are reused. This way  we collect statistics about the _final_ buffer size  rather than the requested sizes or the sizes of capacity bumps. This prevents oscillations that would otherwise be caused by undersized buffers producing a lot of statistics as they resize to their final size  and then no statistics being produced for the final buffer sizes if they are correctly predicted at allocation time.  Result: Calls like `ByteBuf.ensureWritable()` will now on average be much cheaper when using the adaptive allocator.  Based on https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/15062

For now  this is only for the JRE flavor  not for Android.  Our not entirely great benchmarks suggest that this may actually improve performance slightly over the current `Unsafe`-based implementation. This matches my sense that [alternatives to `Unsafe` have gotten faster](https://github.com/google/guava/issues/6806#issuecomment-2518256341).  There are plenty of other [places in Guava that we use `Unsafe`](https://github.com/google/guava/issues/6806)  but this is a start.  Also: I'm going to consider this CL to "fix" https://github.com/google/guava/issues/6549  even though: - We already started requiring newer versions of Java to build our _tests_ in cl/705512728. (This CL is the first to require a newer JDK to build _prod_ code  again only to _build_ it  not to _run_ it.) - We already started requiring newer versions of Java to build our _GWT_ module in cl/711487270. - This CL requires only Java 9  not Java 11. - None of the changes so far should require people who _build our Maven project_ to do anything (aside from GWT users)  since our build automatically downloads a new JDK to use for javac since cl/655647768.

This optimizes for the case where we have many mapping rules with the same expression but different expected values each time. Compilation of expressions is done on-demand and not cached  because a compiled JsonPath expression is not thread-safe. Furthermore  compilation is reasonably fast (one microbenchmark showed 300ns for compilation  100ns for evaluation).  I've also included various related fixes.  closes #32428

Implementation strategy:  - No matter what we do  the JDK is going to allocate a `String[]` to guard (presumably) against concurrent mutation. (Paging [Frozen Arrays](https://openjdk.org/jeps/8261007)?) - Our main ability to optimize around that is to convince the JDK that it can preallocate an array of the proper size. Since the JDK [won't do that in its `Iterable` overload](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8305774)  we want to pass it an array. - Sadly  the JDK requires that the array be of type `CharSequence[]`  so we can't reuse the result of `toArray()`. Thus  if we want to avoid allocating `toArray()` output _on top of_ a `CharSequence[]` and a `String[]`  we have to write directly to a `CharSequence[]` during iteration over the array  with the array pre-sized based on the collection size (but without relying on that size to exactly match what we get from the iteration).

However  this can lead to an explosion in the length of this method  especially for target classes with multiple parents. Long methods are concerning because it can exceed the JVM's default 8 KB limit for method compilation  forcing calls to remain interpreted.  Instead  generate specialized methods for each relevant subtype. This helps break up the monolithic mergeInternal method while not introducing too many method hops.  This approach  however  requires special handling of our bit masks  since we may have more than one long value to represent cases where the model has >64 fields. To deal with this  introduce a specialized case where we use a long[] of values  in order for each specialized method to easily update the overall state. This approach balances optimizing the simple case (<= 64 fields) for performance on small models  while allowing for larger models with only introducing a minimal amount of overhead in the allocation and access of the array values.

Memory allocations: ![Screenshot From 2025-06-24 15-13-33](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e044a63-826d-40d6-856e-a48353b66059)  Cpu time:  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7bdf542-7ed8-4c82-aef4-90e98731736a)  The improvement is only minor (I estimate around 5-7% of `Exporter.export` time)  but it's a quick win.  ### Implementation A global concurrent cache is used to cache valid SemanticVersion instances. After a brief period when versions are added  in steady state no put should be performed  limiting the penalty of the `ConcurrentHashMap`.  ### Limitations There is no check in the size of the cache as only valid semantic versions are inserted. A Caffeine cache could be used if there such need arises.

The -1 case could've been useful to ensure we set the calledProcessDepth correctly for child process instance created after 8.7 that are part of root process instance created prior to 8.7. However  this comes at the cost of performance  as a lookup is needed for each called level.  Instead  we simply set the default to 0  to ensure that all element instances created prior to 8.7  have it set to 0.  This has the added benefit that we do not have to explicitly set the value in other places (like test code).

This is caused by the asynchronous 'close' operation to execute 'connection close' listeners on a session that  in another thread  has already been resumed.  The fix for OF-2808 introduces a Latch  that causes a thread to block. If that thread is one of a Netty EventLoop  all processing stops (possibly leading to the latch never be released  as the connection close listeners cannot operate).  This commit reverts the change for OF-2808  and applies a new fix for that issue: disallow a session that's already in the process of being closed from resumed.

An investigation determined the root cause was the event queue filling up due to all invalidations for all clients being scheduled on a single event thread instead of being balanced across the thread pool. The full write up can be found [here](https://hazelcast.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TES/pages/6009913345/6k+clients+near+cache+failure+analysis).  This change causes invalidation events to be balanced across the threads by using a key derived from the listener registration id instead of the subscriber id (which is always the members local address). All events for the same listener will be processed on the same thread.

This change parallelizes the retrieval process  improving refresh performance  particularly for workloads with frequently changing or slow-loading base tables.  Benchmark Results  with 20 base tables in a materialized view using `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW`: * Avg table load time: 10ms → Refresh time reduced from 560ms to 310ms. * Avg table load time: 100ms → Refresh time reduced by more than 1s.

Caching hash values in GroupByHash is a classic compute / memory trade-off. Caching the value costs more memory (8 extra bytes per record) but avoids relatively more expensive hash recalculation when re-hashing the table or sorting the table contents by raw hash value for spilling. Caching the hash value can also make inserting new entries cheaper by avoiding the need for relatively more expensive valueIdentical checks when the hash value can prove that the values are not identical  although this effect is already somewhat mitigated by the FlatHash control vector.

(#14982)  Motivation:  `HttpMethod#valueOf` has a fast path lookup for _GET_ and _POST_  those call the `HttpMethod#name()` which calls `AsciiString#toString()` and that is not necessary since we can cache the interned corresponding strings locally like `HttpVersion#valueOf` does.  Changes:  Declare _GET_/_POST_ interned string constants and use them for fast path lookup in `valueOf` method.  Result:  Avoid two un-necessaries method call on the fast path.

The first call during init has to be there as we may resume incremental snapshot after streaming init step and need to have schema available. The second refresh seems to be redundant as it's called almost right after init and there doesn't seem to be anything which would require to refresh the schema again just before start actual streaming.

The actual SQL of both definitions is the same. It does not contain any ‘limit’ or ‘top’ clause (although database driver hints are given).  This is likely the result of Openfire supporting multiple database systems  that each have their own clauses to limit a resultset. SQLServer uses SELECT TOP(?) ...  Oracle has ... FETCH FIRST ? ROWS ONLY while other databases generally use ... LIMIT ?. It is inconvenient to fold all these alternatives in one implementation.  In this commit  the code is modified to:  - limit the size of the requested resultset from the database appropriately. - remove SQL duplication (getting the latest item can use the same query as getting the latest X items  using an argument value of 1).  This intends to make the database interaction more efficient (by reducing the likelihood that the database offers up all items for a node  when only a few (or one!) is needed.

Maybe the idea was to indirectly check IMap `InMemoryFormat` to gain some consistency when generating Metadata  but current implementation of `JsonMetadataInitializer` does not benefit from this at all.

Instead of doing the buffering  this commit updates `SdkLengthAwareInputstream` to validate the number of bytes read is correct  and throws an error if EOF is reached prematurely. We use this stream to ensure that we sent the correct amount of bytes to the server when sending the HTTP request.  Note that this a weaker check because we're only testing for the *number* of bytes sent rather than their contents but has the benefit of sidestepping buffering.

For every use case (other than determining if a ‘route is anonymous’)   both caches are operated on. This adds a lot of code complexity  and  as caches are operated on under cluster-wide lock  resource usage.  As the 'route is anonymous' concept has been replaced in the previous commit  the only reason to maintain two caches has been removed.  This commit removes the AnonymousUserCache completely. All data that was previously stored in either UserCache or AnonymousUserCache is now stored in UserCache.

Generally speaking usually you see much more completions compared to submissions  especially as we enable multishot by default these days. Beside this you should also not batch too much in general before submission as this will affect latency. Because of this we should use a more sane default value for the submission queue which will also ensure we submit fast enough while still get some batching to reduce syscalls. Also we need to size the completion queue big enough to be able to receive enough completioms per batch.  Modifications:  - Change the default submission queue size to 128 - Change the default completion queue size to 4096  Result:  Better defaults

We want to add a new configuration compressMinMsgBodySize to the producer configuration. This configuration will allow the user to set the minimum size of the message body that will be compressed. If the message body size is less than the compressMinMsgBodySize  the message will not be compressed.

This provides more efficient storage than `DbInt` or `DbLong`  and avoids the risks of incorrect lookups caused by changes to `ValueType` enum constants ordering.
